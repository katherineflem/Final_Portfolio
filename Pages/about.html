                    <p>My name is Katherine Fleming and I
                        am an aspiring developer and graphic designer in my hometown of New Orleans,
                        Louisiana.I have always been creatively inclined and even started out my college journey at LSU as a
                        graphic
                        design major, and ended up receiving minors in Fine Arts, Mass Communications and Sociology. After
                        college,
                        my
                        interests led me to web design. I moved to Birmingham, Alabama and immersed myself in the tech scene
                        there
                        by
                        enrolling in a coding bootcamp and becoming a full-stack developer while continuing to work a full time
                        job
                        in
                        non-profit. Upon moving back to New Orleans, I wanted to keep learning and gain more confidence in my
                        skills. I
                        enrolled in a Web Design Course and Java Developement Course through Tech Talent South
                        and look forward to the opportunities it brings in New Orleans!</p>
